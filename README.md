## Setup

To **setup** kickstarter, you should run the setup script. To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

or

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
